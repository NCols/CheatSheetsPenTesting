Enumeration
===========
- LinEnum.sh: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh


Enumeration is the process of collecting information about user names, network resources, other machine names,  shares and services running on the network.

- SMB Enumeration:

SMB, which stands for Server Message Block, is a protocol for sharing files, printers, serial ports, and communications abstractions such as named pipes and mail slots between computers.

SMB uses port TCP 139 and 445 as well as several other UDP ports. We can use nmap to find out whether the target is listening to these ports.

- NBTscan

NBTScan is a program for scanning IP networks for NetBIOS name information (similar to what the Windows nbtstat tool provides against single hosts). It sends a NetBIOS status query to each address in a supplied range and lists received information in human readable form. For each responded host it lists IP address, NetBIOS computer name, logged-in user name and MAC address.

Most used options:

nbtscan -v Displays the nbtscan version
nbtscan -f take IP addresses to scan from file filename.
nbtscan -O file-name.txt target(s) Sends output to a file
nbtscan -H Generate an HTTP header
nbtscan -h Print human-readble names for services. Can only be used with -v option.
nbtscan -P Generate Perl hashref output, which can be loaded into an existing program for easier processing, much easier than parsing text output
nbtscan -V Enable verbose mode
nbtscan -n Turns off this inverse name lookup, for hanging resolution
nbtscan -p PORT target(s) This allows specification of a UDP port number to be used as the source in sending a query
nbtscan –m Include the MAC (aka “Ethernet”) addresses in the response, which is already implied by the -f option.
nbtscan -r use local port 137 for scans. Win95 boxes respond to this only. You need to be root to use this option on Unix.

- Enum4linux

Enum4linux is a tool for enumerating information from Windows and Samba systems. It attempts to offer similar functionality to enum.exe formerly available from www.bindview.com.

It is written in Perl and is basically a wrapper around the Samba tools smbclient, rpclient, net and nmblookup.The tool usage can be found below followed by examples, previous versions of the tool can be found at the bottom of the page.

Key features:

RID cycling (When RestrictAnonymous is set to 1 on Windows 2000)
User listing (When RestrictAnonymous is set to 0 on Windows 2000)
Listing of group membership information
Share enumeration
Detecting if host is in a workgroup or a domain
Identifying the remote operating system
Password policy retrieval (using polenum)

Options are (like “enum“):
-U get userlist
–M get machine list*
-S get sharelist
-P get password policy information
-G get group and member list
-d be detailed, applies to -U and -S
–u user specify username to use (default “”)
-p pass specify password to use (default “”)

The following options from enum.exe aren‘t implemented: -L, -N, -D, -f

Additional options:
-a Do all simple enumeration (-U -S -G -P -r –o -n –i).

- SMTP Enumeration (25)

SMTP is a service that can be found in most infrastructure penetration tests.This service can help the penetration tester to perform username enumeration via the EXPN and VRFY commands if these commands have not been disabled by the system administrator.

The role of the EXPN command is to reveal the actual address of users aliases and lists of email and VRFY which can confirm the existance of names of valid users.


- Telnet:

Running a simple telnet <address> <port> will connect us to the server. Using the VRFY command we can query and check if a particular user exists. A 250 SMTP response tells us that the user exists. A 550 or 551 tells us that the user does not exist.

    root@kali:~# telnet 192.168.0.112 25
    Trying 192.168.0.112…
    Connected to 192.168.0.112.
    Escape character is ‘^]’.
    220 bookxp SMTP Server SLmail 5.5.0.4433 Ready ESMTP spoken here
    VRFY georgia
    250 Georgia<georgia@>
    VRFY root
    250 Root User<root@>
    VRFY jp
    551 User not local
    VRFY test01
    551 User not local

We can also use the RCPT command to check if the email exsists:

    root@kali:~# telnet 192.168.0.112 25
    Trying 192.168.0.112…
    Connected to 192.168.0.112.
    Escape character is ‘^]’.
    220 bookxp SMTP Server SLmail 5.5.0.4433 Ready ESMTP spoken here

    MAIL FROM:root
    250 OK
    RCPT TO:georgia
    250 OK
    RCPT TO:test01
    550 User Does Not Exist.


- NCAT

Works in the same way as telnet.

    root@kali:~# nc –nv 192.168.0.112 25
    Ncat: Version 7.70 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )
    Ncat: Connected to 192.168.0.112:25.

    VRFY georgia
    250 Georgia<georgia@>
    VRFY test01
    551 User not local

    MAIL FROM:anybox
    250 OK
    RCPT TO:georgia
    250 OK
    RCPT TO:test01
    550 User Does Not Exist.
    ^C


- NMAP NSE

We can use NMAP scripts to check for existing email addresses.

- smtp-user-enum

Another tool that can be used is the smtp-user-enum which provides 3 methods of user enumeration.The commands that this tool is using in order to verify usernames are the EXPN,VRFY and RCPT.It can also support single username enumeration and multiple by checking through a .txt list. So in order to use this tool effectively you will need to have a good list of usernames.

- SNMP Enumeration (161)

SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) is an application layer protocol which uses UDP protocol to maintain and manage routers, hubs and switches other network devices on an IP network. SNMP is a very common protocol found enabled on a variety of operating systems like Windows Server, Linux & UNIX servers as well as network devices like routers, switches etc.

SNMP enumeration is used to enumerate user accounts, passwords, groups, system names, devices on a target system.

It consists of three major components:

1 – Managed Device: A managed device is a device or a host (technically known as a node) which has the SNMP service enabled. These devices could be routers, switches, hubs, bridges, computers etc.

2 – Agent: An agent can be thought of as a piece of software that runs on a managed device. Its primary job is to convert the information into SNMP compatible format for the smooth management of the network using SNMP protocol.

3- Network Management System (NMS): These are the software systems that are used for monitoring of the network devices.

While running a NMAP on my network I found 2 devices which had SNMP port open. One of them was running SNMPV3 and it is much secure so I used the one using SNMP V1 which is a printer.

- snmpenum

The Snmp Enum is a small Perl script used to enumerate the target SNMP device to get more information about its internal system and network. The key data retrieved may include system users, hardware information, running services, installed software, uptime, share folders, disk drives, IP addresses, network interfaces, and other useful information based on the type of SNMP device (Cisco, Windows, and Linux).

It is located in the following directory in Kali:

- Web Enumeration (80/443)

dirbuster (GUI)

DirBuster is a multi threaded java application designed to brute force directories and files names on web/application servers. Often is the case now of what looks like a web server in a state of default installation is actually not, and has pages and applications hidden within. DirBuster attempts to find these. DirBuster searches for hidden pages and directories on a web server. Sometimes developers will leave a page accessible, but unlinked. DirBuster is meant to find these potential vulnerabilities. This is a Java application developed by OWASP.

Dirbuster has few wordlists that can be used to perform the bruteforce attack.

    root@kali:/usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists# ls -l
    total 7584

    -rw-r–r– 1 root root 676768 Feb 27 2009 directory-list-lowercase-2.3-small.txt

Here is a summary of the most important HTTP status codes that every browser uses and DirBuster utilizes to find directories and files in websites.

• 100 Continue – Codes in the 100 range indicate that, for some reason, the client request has not been completed and the client should continue.
• 200 Successful – Codes in the 200 range generally mean the request was successful.
• 300 Multiple Choices – Codes in the 300 range can mean many things, but generally they mean that the request was not completed.
• 400 Bad Request – The codes in the 400 range generally signal a bad request. The most common is the 404 (not found) and 403 (forbidden).


- Nikto

Nikto is an Open Source (GPL) web server scanner which performs comprehensive tests against web servers for multiple items, including over 6700 potentially dangerous files/programs, checks for outdated versions of over 1250 servers, and version specific problems on over 270 servers. It also checks for server configuration items such as the presence of multiple index files, HTTP server options, and will attempt to identify installed web servers and software. Scan items and plugins are frequently updated and can be automatically updated.
Nikto is a perl based security testing tool and this means it will run on most operating systems with the necessary Perl interpreter installed.

- Netdiscover

Netdiscover is a simple but powerful tool that uses the ARP protocol to discover live network hosts. As long as you are connected to the network and ARP is enabled on the network, you should be able to discover every live host’s IP and MAC address. Once you have those, then you can begin your strategy of exploiting those hosts.
